Name:Open-discord-n-log-Power-Automate-
des:loger for discord (for me, backup of code)
notes:

btw on your desktop on mid of it make-sure it has no apps inless its "log.txt"!

this maked on windows 10 but it sold work for 11!

AND the "main-code" file open it with note-pad! or whatever text app you use!, copy the txt in the file! put it in power automate!, if noting chage the user name in the code!
